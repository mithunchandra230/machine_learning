# Machine Learning Projects

This repository contains a collection of my machine learning projects developed to demonstrate my practical understanding of real-world data problems, model building, and end-to-end ML pipelines. Each project is designed to solve a specific problem using supervised learning techniques.

## About Me

I am a machine learning enthusiast with hands-on experience in data preprocessing, exploratory data analysis, feature engineering, model training, hyperparameter tuning, and evaluation. My learning journey has been driven by building projects that reflect industry-relevant problems and deploying solutions using Python and popular ML libraries like scikit-learn, pandas, NumPy, and Matplotlib.

I am currently seeking a full-time opportunity where I can contribute meaningfully using my skills and continue to grow as a data-driven problem solver. I believe in learning by doing, and this repository showcases the effort I have put into developing and refining my practical skills.

## Projects Included

1. **Vehicle Price Prediction**  
2. **Heart Disease Prediction**  
3. **Fraud Detection**

Each project has its own folder with a dedicated `README.md` file that explains the problem statement, dataset used, methodology, results, and insights. You can refer to those individual files for detailed information.

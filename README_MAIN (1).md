# Machine Learning Projects


This repository contains several machine learning projects I created to showcase my real-world situations and application of machine learning. Each project fixes a specific problem, using supervised learning to create a model and working with an end-to-end ML pipeline.


## About Me

I am now a machine learning enthusiast with the hands-on experience and knowledge of data pre-processing, exploratory data analysis, feature engineering, model training, hyperparameter tuning, and evaluation. All have been achieved and generated through my experience of building projects which closely matched any of the ML problems as seen in industry, ultimately resulting in codes and solutions generated using Python and some of the most popular ML libraries, such as, scikit-learn, pandas, NumPy and Matplotlib.

I am looking for a full-time opportunity that allows me to contribute in a meaningful way using my skills and, at the same time, to further develop my data-driven problem-solving skills. I am a believer of learning-by-doing; this repository captures the amount of focused effort I put into developing and enhancing my practical skills.


## Projects Included


1. Vehicles Price Prediction

2. Heart Disease Prediction
  
3. Fraud Detection


Each project has its own folder and has a respective `README.md` file that includes the problem statement, dataset used, methodology employed, evaluation, and conclusion. I won't include that detail here, but please feel free to explore the individual readmes.

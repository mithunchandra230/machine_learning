# Machine Learning Projects

This repository contains a collection of machine learning projects developed using various supervised learning techniques and standard data preprocessing workflows. Each project is organized in its own directory with relevant code, datasets (or dataset links), and a dedicated README file that explains the implementation in detail.

## Contents

1. **Vehicle Price Prediction**  
   A regression-based machine learning model for predicting vehicle prices.  
   *Refer to the README file in the `vehicle_price_prediction` directory for details.*

2. **Heart Disease Prediction**  
   A classification model that predicts the presence of heart disease based on medical parameters.  
   *Refer to the README file in the `heart_disease_prediction` directory for details.*

3. **Fraud Detection**  
   A binary classification project to detect fraudulent transactions using supervised learning techniques.  
   *Refer to the README file in the `fraud_detection` directory for details.*

## Getting Started

To run any of the projects:

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/your-repo-name.git
   cd your-repo-name
   ```

2. Navigate to the specific project folder:
   ```bash
   cd vehicle_price_prediction  # or heart_disease_prediction, fraud_detection
   ```

3. Follow the instructions in that folderâ€™s README file to set up the environment, install dependencies, and run the code.

## Requirements

Each project contains its own list of dependencies in the respective README file. Common libraries used across projects may include:
- pandas
- numpy
- scikit-learn
- matplotlib / seaborn
- Jupyter Notebook or standard Python scripts

Ensure you are using Python 3.7 or above for compatibility.

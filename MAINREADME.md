# Machine Learning Project Portfolio

Welcome to my personal machine learning project repository. This collection showcases practical implementations of ML concepts across real-world datasets.

## About Me
I am Chandra Shekar Chilukamary, a passionate automation tester and machine learning enthusiast. I specialize in applying data science techniques to solve real-life problems, focusing on simplicity, efficiency, and performance. This GitHub profile reflects my journey through hands-on ML projects, continuous learning, and technical growth.

## Repository Structure

Each project is organized in a separate branch with its own README:
- **Vehicle Price Prediction**: Uses regression to estimate used car prices.
- **Heart Disease Prediction**: Classification model to identify patients at risk.
- **Fraud Transaction Detection**: Detects fraudulent transactions with high precision.

## Tech Stack
- Python (NumPy, Pandas, Matplotlib, Seaborn, Scikit-learn)
- Jupyter Notebooks
- Git & GitHub

## Purpose
This repository is created not only to document my learning but also to help others who are exploring machine learning and applied data science.

# Vehicle Price Prediction

## Overview
This project aims to predict the price of used vehicles using a machine learning regression model. By analyzing various features like brand, model, manufacturing year, mileage, fuel type, and engine size, the model provides estimated prices with good accuracy.

## Objective
- Analyze and clean real-world used car datasets.
- Perform feature engineering and visualization.
- Train regression models to predict vehicle prices.

## Workflow
1. Data loading and preprocessing
2. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
3. Feature transformation
4. Model training (Linear Regression, Random Forest, etc.)
5. Evaluation using MAE, RMSE
6. Predict live vehicle prices

## Technologies
- Python (Pandas, NumPy)
- Matplotlib, Seaborn
- Scikit-learn

## Result
Achieved a reliable prediction pipeline that can estimate the resale value of any given car with reasonable accuracy.

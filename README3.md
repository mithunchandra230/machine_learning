# Fraud Transaction Detection

## Overview
This project detects fraudulent transactions using classification algorithms. It is based on a financial dataset where transactions are labeled as fraudulent or legitimate.

## Objective
- Clean and explore transaction data
- Handle class imbalance
- Build and evaluate fraud detection models

## Workflow
1. Data preprocessing
2. Dealing with imbalanced classes (SMOTE or under-sampling)
3. Train classification models (Logistic Regression, Random Forest, etc.)
4. Evaluation using Accuracy, Precision, Recall, and F1-Score
5. Predict and flag suspicious transactions

## Technologies
- Python (Pandas, NumPy)
- Scikit-learn
- Matplotlib

## Result
A model capable of identifying fraudulent transactions with high precision, helping to reduce financial risk and fraud losses.

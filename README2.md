# Heart Disease Prediction

## Overview
This classification project predicts the likelihood of heart disease based on patient medical data. The model uses various features like cholesterol, blood pressure, age, and chest pain type to assess risk levels.

## Objective
- Preprocess healthcare data
- Train classification models to predict heart disease risk
- Evaluate the model's accuracy and probability scores

## Workflow
1. Data cleaning and exploration
2. Label encoding of categorical features
3. Feature selection
4. Model training (Logistic Regression, Random Forest, etc.)
5. Model evaluation (Accuracy, ROC-AUC)
6. Live prediction based on user inputs

## Technologies
- Python (Pandas, NumPy)
- Scikit-learn
- Matplotlib

## Result
The model successfully identifies high-risk individuals, providing a decision support tool for early diagnosis of heart disease.

# Predicting Vehicle Price

The goal of this project was to create a machine learning model to predict the market price of used vehicles given a number of features. The project includes all aspects of an ML modelling process to bring to fruition as follows: data preprocessing, data visualisation, modelling, and evaluating.

## Aim

To develop a predictive model to the best level of accuracy possible to predict vehicle price using various features of the vehicle, such as brand, model, year, mileage, fuel type, and body type.

## Problem Statement

We have one dataset of used cars and we want to use supervised regression algorithms to predict market price. The solution will leverage missing values, and categorical variables and be his own evaluation.

## Walkthrough of Workflow Steps

1. **Loading the Dataset**: Load in the dataset with pandas and explore the data looking for any missing values; 
2. **Exploratory Data Analysis**: Plot data distribution of prices, mileage and categorical graphs; 
3. **Preprocessing**: Fill in missing values, remove unnecessary columns, and apply one-hot encoding;
4. **Model Building**: Train linear regression and random forest models; 
5. **Evaluation**: Evaluate models using MAE, RMSE and R squared aggregate score.

The project compares which model is doing better for price predictions in a setting to highlight learned conclusions on vehicle price prediction. The code is reframed responsively to suggest it may include extending into a deployed application or bundling into larger, larger project.
